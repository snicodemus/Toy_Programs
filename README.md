# Toy Programs

These are small programs that I have written over the years. They have involved something that amused me
or that seemed interesting at the time.

## :christmas_tree: TwelveDays.java
This is an extremely short program that prints the lyrics of The Twelve Days of Christmas. It uses a
for loop to go through each day, and a switch statement without break statements to just print the
appropriate parts of each verse.

## :trollface: Replicate.java
This program was inspired by a rereading of Douglas Hofstadter's *GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach*. It replicates
itself. In other words, the output of the program is the program itself. ReplicateWithComments.java is
the same with comments briefly explaining how it works. If I ever have some extra time (yeah, right),
maybe I'll rewrite it so it prints itself including the comments.

## :smiling_imp: Crazy.java
This program puts an exit button in the middle of the window. When the cursor moves over the button, it
jumps to a random location within the window. I wrote the same thing in Visual Basic long ago, and it
was only two lines of code. I wanted to determine if it could be done in Java, because it doesn't seem
to like the programmer to have much control of the specific layout of components.
